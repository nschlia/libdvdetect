There are three examples:

dvdinfo

  This example reads the information of a DVD and displays them in a rather
  confusing manner. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to
  traverse through the DVD structure. 

dvdlookup
  
  This example reads structure of a DVD, tries to look it up on the
  server and displays the information (or simply that it is not found). 
  The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to get the 
  information from the server and then traverse through the DVD 
  structure to display it. There is also an option to write the data 
  retrieved into an xml file that can be edited and submitted to the 
  server (using the dvdsubmit example program).

dvdsubmit

  This example reads the information of a DVD from an xml file, and
  submits it to the server. The purpose of this example is to
  demonstrate how to submit information to the server.

Examples are available in both C and C++.

If you want a more clearly arranged look, better check out the Qt GUI 
example instead, see the Qt directory.
