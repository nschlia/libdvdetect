  * Created

2012-06-09 nschlia V0.20

  * Bugfix: Removed VS2010 solution from distribution (not ready for release yet.
      BTW it is perfectly OK to use the regular gcc compiled dll with VS projects anyways).
  * Added support for PTT (Video Manager Title Map) which represents the Title/Chapter structure
      intended by the author
  * Added physical/virtual view check box to Qt example.
  * Library internal code: Changed several pointers to const where they should be
  * Library internal code: Changed several declarations to their typedef
  * Same for examples
  * Tested parser with some 500 DVDs (without obvious errors and no crashes :)
  * Bugfix: Last chapter/program had no cells for multiangle program chains
  * Bugfix: DVDPTT program chain number field was duplicate
  * Bugfix: File size/playtime are added several times for multi angle DVDs
  * Bugfix: File sizes corrected (should use unit size instead of cell size)
  * Bugfix: "Full scan" (AKA really check files on disk) was not completely implemented...

2012-06-15 nschlia V0.21

  * Bugfix: fix crash when more virtual titles exist than defined by video manager (DVD authoring flaw)
      Happened e.g. with "King of Queens" Season 5 Disk 3 (seven virtual titles in VMG, but eight on disk)
  * Added command line options to examples (-d PATH, -p Physical View, -h Help)
  * Examples now also support physical/virtual view
  * Bugfix: Missing error messages added if target directory not acessible or empty 
  * Changed Qt example dialog name from expressionless "MainWindow" to better matching "dvdexplorerdlg"
  * Bugfix: Title menu VOBs were duplicate in full scan
  
2012-06-29 nschlia V0.30

  * Bugfix: sealed memory leak in getString function
  * Bugfix: closed memory leak in Qt example
  * Syntax: changed some "delete" to "delete []" (although this is a formal change only without effect,
      because the array is of type char and not an array of classes.)
  * Bugfix: library version number stayed at 0.10.0 (was accidentally hardcoded in makefile.am).
  * Added about dialog
  * Added cygwin support
  * Bugfix: http problems were not properly reported (empty error message)
  * Bugfix: library version number did not change (remained 0.10.0)
  * Added DVD lookup from database
  * Added DVD submit to database
  * Created server side PHP scripts for query, search, submit
  * Implemented data exchange with database using XML
  * Implemented DVD lookup example
  * Implemented DVD data editing inside GUI example
  * Added cygwin support

2012-08-03 nschlia V0.40

TOTALLY REVAMPED XML FORMAT!

Older clients will no longer work. This is the desired behaviour, as we now start with the real protocol
that should be in use from now on. Therefore, from this moment on, client 0.40+ is required. Old clients
should be gracefully rejected, but do not rely on that...
  
  * Big concept change: Now the whole DVD structure gets store in DB, not only a small part of it.
    See NEWS for details why.
  * Bugfix: STL classes had crashes under linux. Completely revamped vector classes.
  * Bugfix: The server sent out data in "chunked transfer encoding" with which the http classes did not
    get by - changed PHP code so that the Content-Size header gets sent (as the xml document size is
    known in advance anyways and can be sent).
  * Added options dialog to guiexample. Database server name, submitter and proxy name can now be set.
  * Bugfix: Fixed troubles with utf-8 conversions GUI example
  * Bugfix: SQL error messages were sometimes empty.
  * Proxy can now be set
  * GUI example dialog now supports auto resize
  * Bugfix: Fixed crash after dvdGetErrorMessage() call when trying to dvdFree() the memory (memory
    was not allocated on heap).
  * Added guiexamplestatic project to Qt example - compiles complete app including the library. No
    separate compile required.
  * renamed many variables for a more common name scheme
  * removed count variables that also had an accessor (e.g. getTitleCount and m_wNumberOfTitles). These
    were not always in sync, causing a lot of grief...
  * Updated the doxygen comments, found a lot of typos, wrong explanations, missing descriptions and more.
    Fixed, added, whatever.
  * Examples: Revamped error handling and display
  * Examples: Added submit example
  * Added read/write of DVD from/to xml
  * Qt Example: Added menu entry to read/write DVD from/to xml
  * Renamed "emailaddress" field to "submitter". Put anything there, a synonym, a real name. But to counteract
    spam, never an email adress.
  * Conditionally removed md5 code: If openssl/md5.h exists, the crypto library will be used. Otherwise our own 
    code is linked.
  * PHP part checks protocol version now and rejects access when not supported
  * Added version number to Qt Example caption
  * md5 code will only be used if no library available on system. On *nix, libcrypto will be used. Install openssl for
    support.
  * Qt Example: will now automatically query after a DVD was scanned. Saves some extra clicks.
  * Tested library support for: Windoze, Suse 11.3, Suse 12.2, Debian Squeeze, Cygwin
  * Added PHP code to doxygen, but this part has still to be documented (most doxygen headers are missing).
  * Added missing dvdGetFileName function
  * Optimised error handling (quite a few problems got by unreported)

2012-08-XX nschlia V0.50

PLANNED FOR NEXT RELEASE:

  * If a submitter re-submits the same DVD, the database gets updated instead of creating a new revision.
    This avoids creating several revisions with minor changes.
