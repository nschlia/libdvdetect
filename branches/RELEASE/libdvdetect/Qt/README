Qt examples:

  guiexample

      This is an example written in C++ using the Qt library. It has
      a GUI and presents a much more clearly arranged look at the
      DVD structures.

      If you have Qt Creator, try it, it may help to understand DVDs
      a lot. If not, get it (http://qt-project.org/downloads), it's
      multi platform and definetly worth a try.
