These are three small C examples that demonstrate how to:

* read a DVD structure (dvdinfo) 
* query a DVD from the libdvdetect server (dvdlookup)
* submit a DVD from the libdvdetect server (dvdsubmit)

To read a DVD structure:

dvdinfo -d f:\

To query a DVD from the database:

dvdlookup -d f:\

To submit a DVD, first run dvdlookup to query the server and write the result
as xml:

dvdlookup -d f: -o mydvd.xml

If not found, edit the xml file an submit the DVD to the server:

dvsubmit -i mydvd.xml
