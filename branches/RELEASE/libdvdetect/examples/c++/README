These are three small C++ examples that demonstrate how to:

* read a DVD structure (dvdinfocxx) 
* query a DVD from the libdvdetect server (dvdlookupcxx)
* submit a DVD from the libdvdetect server (dvdsubmitcxx)

To read a DVD structure:

dvdinfocxx -d f:\

To query a DVD from the database:

dvdlookupcxx -d f:\

To submit a DVD, first run dvdlookupcxx to query the server and write the result
as xml:

dvdlookupcxx -d f: -o mydvd.xml

If not found, edit the xml file an submit the DVD to the server:

dvsubmitcxx -i mydvd.xml
