2012-06-08 V0.20 released!

The maintenance release is ready: The biggest changes are concerning the documentation (added
and updated a lot of doxygen style comments) and the support for part-of-title indexes. The
rest is of cosmetical nature and a few refactorings.

Next: Actual DVD database lookup will be added.

This is a humongous task: Not only that the code needs to be written, but I will also have to
type in some of my DVDs for lookup testing. So please stay tuned.
