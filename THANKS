  I would like to thank the following people for their contribution to
  the libdvdetect project.

George Dumond (http://www.codeguru.com/member.php/Georges+Dumond/)

  He wrote the DVD Explorer for MFC which has given me a good head start
  and worked well for a long time until I need to add some functionality
  that was not possible due to the structure of the project.
