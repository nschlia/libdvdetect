WHAT IS libdvdetect

DOCUMENTATION

The API documentation can be consulted on the project homepage:
    http://www.libdvdetect.de/

It is possible to create your own copy of this documentation in both
HTML and LaTeX format using the doxygen program (http://doxygen.org).
If you have doxygen installed, execute the following command in the
doc/ directory:

    doxygen doxygen.conf

This will create two subdirectories html/ and latex/ in which you will
find the documentation in the respective formats.

COMPILING

To compile. do the usual "configure" and then "make".

For windows, you should get GNU MSYS which provides the set of UNIX 
tools required, as well as the GNU compiler (mingw):

http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS

It should be possible to compile everything with M$ Visual C, but you 
still need to do configure beforehand to get some required headers like 
config.h and version.h.

Tested environments:

* Suse 12.2
* Suse 11.4
* Debian (Debian 2.6.32-48squeeze1)
* Windows 7 (using GNU MSYS)
* Windows Cygwin

See INSTALL for instructions.

WARNING

THIS IS AN EARLY STAGE BETA WHICH WILL UNDERGO A LOT OF CHANGES ON THE
RELEASE. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM DOING "make install" FOR NOW!

This could distribute files which may be in the way for later releases
or cause other disturbances, because this part of make has not been
undergone testing as of yet
