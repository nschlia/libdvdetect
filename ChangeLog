  * Created

2012-06-09 nschlia V0.20

  * Bugfix: Removed VS2010 solution from distribution (not ready for release yet.
      BTW it is perfectly OK to use the regular gcc compiled dll with VS projects anyways).
  * Added support for PTT (Video Manager Title Map) which represents the Title/Chapter structure
      intended by the author
  * Added physical/virtual view check box to Qt example.
  * Library internal code: Changed several pointers to const where they should be
  * Library internal code: Changed several declarations to their typedef
  * Same for examples
  * Tested parser with some 500 DVDs (without obvious errors and no crashes :)
  * Bugfix: Last chapter/program had no cells for multiangle program chains
  * Bugfix: DVDPTT program chain number field was duplicate
  * Bugfix: File size/playtime are added several times for multi angle DVDs
  * Bugfix: File sizes corrected (should use unit size instead of cell size)
  * Bugfix: "Full scan" (AKA really check files on disk) was not completely implemented...

2012-06-15 nschlia V0.21

  * Bugfix: fix crash when more virtual titles exist than defined by video manager (DVD authoring flaw)
      Happened e.g. with "King of Queens" Season 5 Disk 3 (seven virtual titles in VMG, but eight on disk)
  * Added command line options to examples (-d PATH, -p Physical View, -h Help)
  * Examples now also support physical/virtual view
  * Bugfix: Missing error messages added if target directory not acessible or empty 
  * Changed Qt example dialog name from expressionless "MainWindow" to better matching "dvdexplorerdlg"
  * Bugfix: Title menu VOBs were duplicate in full scan
  
2012-06-29 nschlia V0.30

  * Bugfix: sealed memory leak in getString function
  * Bugfix: closed memory leak in Qt example
  * Syntax: changed some "delete" to "delete []" (although this is a formal change only without effect,
      because the array is of type char and not an array of classes.)

  * Added about dialog
  * Added cygwin support
  * Bugfix: http problems were not properly reported (empty error message)
