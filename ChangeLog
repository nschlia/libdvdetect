2015-07-26 nschlia V0.60

  * Changed order in ChangeLog to have the latest release on top.
  * Reformatted ChangeLog to look better when viewed online in Github.

TODO:

  * If a submitter re-submits the same DVD, the database gets updated instead of creating 
    a new revision. This avoids creating several revisions with minor changes.
    
FIXES:

11704 Fix crash when DVD not found in database
11472 Wrong virtual title selection fixed: take from program
11469 Wrong virtual title selection fixed (testing!)


2013-09-19 nschlia V0.50

Living in the past: All releases in this document were dated back to 2012, but I guess the 
year already is 2013. So the dates were corrected.

  * Added missing fields that proved to be useful: `OriginalAlbum`, `Screenplay`,
    `Producer`, `Editing`, `Cinematography`, `OriginalLanguage`
  * Changed `Cast` field type from varchar(120) to text (needs more space)
  * Bugfix: `OriginalAlbum` database field changed from char(120) to varchar(120)
  * Qt Example: Edit dialog's QTreeView was missing "Line Wrap" attribute (e.g. cast list
    needs that)
  * Qt Example: Edit dialog's submitter name cannot be edited, set to read-only
  * Bugfix: Submitter was always overwritten with default submitter "***ChangeMe!***"
  * Added option to do full scan automatically (can be never, always or auto). Auto means
    full scan will not be done on web sources to speed up the process.
  * Qt Example: Added option to select scan mode (see options dialog).
  * Bugfix: Full scan could not be deselected
  * Bugfix: File time/size for BUP files were empty when not full in scan
  * Bugfix: IPv6 was not properly handled. According to RFC, the client should fall back to
    IPv4 if IPv6 was available, but failed. This will now be done: Try IPv6 first, resort
    to IPv4 if it fails.
  * Bugfix: Only 7 audio/subpicture streams possible (instead of 8), it was possible to
    add such DVDs to the database but queries failed with an error.
  * Added new error code for DVD not found (see DVDERRORCODE enum). Allows to distinguish
    between real errors and simply no DVD found.

2013-08-03 nschlia V0.40

TOTALLY REVAMPED XML FORMAT!

Older clients will no longer work. This is the desired behaviour, as we now start with the
real protocol that should be in use from now on. Therefore, from this moment on, client
0.40+ is required. Old clients should be gracefully rejected, but do not rely on that...
  
  * Big concept change: Now the whole DVD structure gets store in DB, not only a small
    part of it. See NEWS for details why.
  * Bugfix: STL classes had crashes under linux. Completely revamped vector classes.
  * Bugfix: The server sent out data in "chunked transfer encoding" with which the http
    classes did not get by - changed PHP code so that the Content-Size header gets sent
    (as the xml document size is known in advance anyways and can be sent).
  * Added options dialog to guiexample. Database server name, submitter and proxy name can
    now be set.
  * Bugfix: Fixed troubles with utf-8 conversions GUI example
  * Bugfix: SQL error messages were sometimes empty.
  * Proxy can now be set
  * GUI example dialog now supports auto resize
  * Bugfix: Fixed crash after dvdGetErrorMessage() call when trying to dvdFree() the memory
    (memory was not allocated on heap).
  * Added guiexamplestatic project to Qt example - compiles complete app including the
    library. No separate compile required.
  * renamed many variables for a more common name scheme
  * removed count variables that also had an accessor (e.g. getTitleCount and
    m_wNumberOfTitles). These were not always in sync, causing a lot of grief...
  * Updated the doxygen comments, found a lot of typos, wrong explanations, missing
    descriptions and more. Fixed, added, whatever.
  * Examples: Revamped error handling and display
  * Examples: Added submit example
  * Added read/write of DVD from/to xml
  * Qt Example: Added menu entry to read/write DVD from/to xml
  * Renamed "emailaddress" field to "submitter". Put anything there, a synonym, a real name.
    But to counteract spam, never an email adress.
  * Conditionally removed md5 code: If openssl/md5.h exists, the crypto library will be used.
    Otherwise our own code is linked.
  * PHP part checks protocol version now and rejects access when not supported
  * Added version number to Qt Example caption
  * md5 code will only be used if no library available on system. On *nix, libcrypto will be
    used. Install openssl for support.
  * Qt Example: will now automatically query after a DVD was scanned. Saves some extra clicks.
  * Tested library support for: Windoze, Suse 11.3, Suse 12.2, Debian Squeeze, Cygwin
  * Added PHP code to doxygen, but this part has still to be documented (most doxygen headers
    are missing).
  * Added missing dvdGetFileName function
  * Optimised error handling (quite a few problems got by unreported)

2013-06-29 nschlia V0.30

  * Bugfix: sealed memory leak in getString function
  * Bugfix: closed memory leak in Qt example
  * Syntax: changed some "delete" to "delete []" (although this is a formal change only
    without effect, because the array is of type char and not an array of classes.)
  * Bugfix: library version number stayed at 0.10.0 (was accidentally hardcoded in
    makefile.am).
  * Added about dialog
  * Added cygwin support
  * Bugfix: http problems were not properly reported (empty error message)
  * Bugfix: library version number did not change (remained 0.10.0)
  * Added DVD lookup from database
  * Added DVD submit to database
  * Created server side PHP scripts for query, search, submit
  * Implemented data exchange with database using XML
  * Implemented DVD lookup example
  * Implemented DVD data editing inside GUI example
  * Added cygwin support

2013-06-15 nschlia V0.21

  * Bugfix: fix crash when more virtual titles exist than defined by video manager (DVD
    authoring flaw) Happened e.g. with "King of Queens" Season 5 Disk 3 (seven virtual
    titles in VMG, but eight on disk)
  * Added command line options to examples (-d PATH, -p Physical View, -h Help)
  * Examples now also support physical/virtual view
  * Bugfix: Missing error messages added if target directory not acessible or empty 
  * Changed Qt example dialog name from expressionless "MainWindow" to better matching
    "dvdexplorerdlg"
  * Bugfix: Title menu VOBs were duplicate in full scan
  
2013-06-09 nschlia V0.20

  * Bugfix: Removed VS2010 solution from distribution (not ready for release yet.
    BTW it is perfectly OK to use the regular gcc compiled dll with VS projects anyways).
  * Added support for PTT (Video Manager Title Map) which represents the Title/Chapter
    structure intended by the author
  * Added physical/virtual view check box to Qt example.
  * Library internal code: Changed several pointers to const where they should be
  * Library internal code: Changed several declarations to their typedef
  * Same for examples
  * Tested parser with some 500 DVDs (without obvious errors and no crashes :)
  * Bugfix: Last chapter/program had no cells for multiangle program chains
  * Bugfix: DVDPTT program chain number field was duplicate
  * Bugfix: File size/playtime are added several times for multi angle DVDs
  * Bugfix: File sizes corrected (should use unit size instead of cell size)
  * Bugfix: "Full scan" (AKA really check files on disk) was not completely implemented...
